# InspireNest
InspireNest is a purpose driven web application created from my own idea to support mentally disabled children through learning, emotional care, creativity, and daily skills. I used AI in the right way to reduce my frontend effort and quickly turn my idea into a working website in about 5-7 minutes, while focusing on design and user experience.
